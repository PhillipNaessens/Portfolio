<h1>Cookie Policy for Surfdom</h1>

<p>This is the Cookie Policy for Surfdom, accessible from www.Surfdom.com</p>

<p><strong>What Are Cookies</strong></p>

<p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, to steal what little agency you have left. This page describes what information they repossess, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies indefinitely; denying you the right to be forgotten. We will also be so kind as to share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored, but be warned; this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site's functionality so either cough up your personal info or fuck off.</p>

<p>For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia article on HTTP Cookies.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></p>

<p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately (for you, actually rather fortunate for us) in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. We could have constructed this site to function independent of spyware, but where would be the fun in that?</p>

<p><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></p>

<p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in a complete system failure and possible physical harm. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not disable cookies. If you do however wish to proceed in disabling cookies there is little no guarantee that we will pay any heed to your request.</p>

<p><strong>The Cookies We Set</strong></p>

<ul>

    <p>Site preferences cookies</p>
    <p>In order to provide you with the mediocre experience of surfing the web you have come to expect, we provide the functionality to set your preferences for how this site runs when you use it. In order to remember your preferences forever in memorial, we need to set cookies so that this information can be called whenever you interact with a page is affected by your preferences.</p>


</ul>

<p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></p>

<p>In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted as well as untrusted third parties. The following section details which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.</p>

<ul>

<li>
    <p>This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and untrusted analytics solutions on the web for helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve our profit margins. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site, the pages that you visit (yes, even those pages), what you had for breakfast, your private conversations, your appearance, your gender, your bank account details and much, much more so that we can continue to produce engaging yet mindless content. </p>
    <p>For more information on Google Analytics cookies, see the official Google Analytics page.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the way that we monitor your everyday life. These heightened surveillance techniques will be retroactively added to this cookie policy making the impossible to say no to.  </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>As we don't sell any physical products, it is our imperative to turn you and your behavioural tendencies into raw material to produce prediction tools. That's right; you're machine food. For example, remember last Saturday when you bought that jacket from Amazon because you thought it suited you and your sense of individualism? Well it turns out that we poked and prodded you in that direction to appease our clients (the advertisers that is; not you, you filthy peasant).</p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>The Google AdSense service we use to serve advertising uses a DoubleClick cookie to serve more relevant ads across the web and limit the number of times that a given ad is shown to you. In-house, we call this method brute force. If one ad doesnâ€™t work we have a infinite supply to chuck at you until one of them sticks.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>We use adverts to offset the costs of running this site by a factor of a billion at the very least. The behavioural advertising cookies used by this site are designed to ensure that we provide you with the most relevant and personal adverts that pretty much guarantee that you express the behavioural habits that we desire. This is made possible by (not-so) anonymously tracking your interests and presenting similar things that may be of interest. Or not. Sometimes we might throw you down a rabbit hole of radicalization. Depends on our algorithm's mood really.</p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>Several partners advertise on our behalf and affiliate tracking cookies simply allow us infiltrate ever</p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>We also use social media buttons and/or plugins on this site that allow you to connect with your social network in various ways. For these to work the following social media sites including; Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will set cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your data profile on their site or contribute to the vast amount of personal information they already hold over you.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you aren't sure about; fuck right off. You are not in the know and never will be. This is our domain, and you are but our humble subjects.
However, if you are still looking for more information then you can contact us via Satanic ritual.
