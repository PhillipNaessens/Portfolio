  <h1>Obscuring the View From My Window</h1>
<p1>'Obscurring the View From My Window' was a live VJ'ing performance set to the song 'Creeping Shadows' by Sobrio. The concept of this performance was the collision of worlds. On one hand we have the human plane of existence and on the other we have the realm of informantion. This set seeks to bring these two worlds into collision.<br><br> This performance was created using both Adobe After Effects as well as Modul8. </p1>
